						This is for kids who are less than the age of 8. These are in this special category because they are really young but their interest in football is impressive. These kids have less intensive training (of course) but very wonderful sessions where each of them can showcase what they have learnt.

						This is a section specially for kids who are still pursuing education in school. We understand that there are those who cannot attend the academy 24/7 because of the commitment in school. Well, this is the right place for you. We allow them to come to the academy in the afternoons when they are free.
